## Submiting contributions 
1. Fork the Black Mamba repository to your own GitHub account.

2. Create a new branch on your forked repository for your changes.

3. Make your changes in your new branch, following our code style and conventions. Be sure to test your changes thoroughly.

4. When you are ready to submit your changes, create a pull request from your new branch to the main Black Mamba repository.

5. Your pull request will be reviewed by one of our maintainers. They may request additional changes or provide feedback on your contribution.

6. Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main repository and your changes will be included in the next release of Black Mamba.

Please note that all contributions must adhere to our Code of Conduct and follow the guidelines set out in our CONTRIBUTING.md file. We reserve the right to reject any contributions that do not meet these standards.

## Code formatting guidelines
Consistent code formatting is important for readability and maintainability of the Black Mamba codebase. Here are the guidelines we follow for formatting our code:

1. Indentation: Use tabs instead four spaces for indentation.

2. Line length: Keep lines shorter than 60 characters.

3. Line breaks: Use Unix-style line breaks (LF) instead of Windows-style line breaks (CRLF).

4. Function and class definitions: Separate the function and class definitions with one blank lines.

5. Imports: Put all import statements at the top of the file, after any module-level docstrings and before any global variable declarations.

6. Naming conventions: Follow the Black Mamba naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes. Variable names should be in 
lower case with words separated by underscores(better convenstion). Function and class names should be in camel case with the first letter of each word capitalized.

7. Commenting: Use descriptive comments to explain the purpose of your code. Use inline comments sparingly and only when 
necessary to clarify the code.

8. max line : keep max line shorter than 79

## Contribution to the standard library
Contributing to the standard library of Black Mamba is a great way to make a lasting impact on the language 
and its community. The standard library is the set of modules that are distributed with Black Mamba, and are 
available for use in any Black Mamba program.

To contribute to the standard library, you can start by identifying areas that need improvement or new functionality. 
Then, you can create a fork of the Black Mamba repository and make your changes in a new branch. Once your changes are complete, 
submit a pull request to the upstream repository.

Before submitting a pull request, be sure to follow the code formatting guidelines and include thorough documentation for your 
changes. Your code should also be well-tested and pass all relevant tests.

Contributions to the standard library are subject to review by the Black Mamba development team. If your contribution is accepted, 
it will be merged into the main branch and become a part of the next release of Black Mamba.

## improving documentation
Improving the documentation of Black Mamba is an essential way to contribute to the 
community. Good documentation helps users understand how to use Black Mamba effectively and efficiently.

To improve the documentation, you can start by identifying areas that need clarification, expansion, or correction. You can 
then create a fork of the Black Mamba repository and make your changes in a new branch. Once your changes are complete, 
submit a pull request to the upstream repository.

When making changes to the documentation, be sure to follow the documentation guidelines and style guide. Your changes should be clear, 
concise, and easy to understand. If you're unsure about how to structure your documentation or what information to include, 
feel free to reach out to the Black Mamba community for guidance.

Improvements to the documentation are subject to review by the Black Mamba development team. If your contribution is accepted, 
it will be merged into the main branch and become a part of the next release of Black Mamba.

## Git recommendations for pull requests
1. Create a new branch: Before making changes to the code, create a new branch that is separate from the main branch. This will allow you to make changes without affecting the main branch and make it easier to manage and review your changes.

2. Keep your pull request small and focused: Avoid making too many changes in one pull request. Instead, break your changes into small, focused chunks that are easy to understand and review.

3. Provide clear and descriptive commit messages: Write clear and descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose of your changes. This will make it easier for other developers to understand your changes and for you to track the history of your contributions.

4. Test your changes: Before submitting a pull request, test your changes to ensure that they are working as intended. This will help to avoid conflicts and ensure that your changes are effective.

5. Respond to feedback: Be open to feedback and willing to make changes based on the review. Respond to any questions or comments in a timely manner to keep the review process moving smoothly.

## Realeases
Black Mamba releases new versions periodically, including bug fixes, improvements, and new features. When a new release is available, it is recommended to update your local copy of Black Mamba to ensure that you have the latest improvements and bug fixes.

1. Check the changelog: Before updating to a new release, it's recommended to check the changelog to see what has changed. The changelog will list all the bug fixes, improvements, and new features that are included in the new release.

2. Backup your code: It's always a good idea to back up your code before making any changes or updates. This will ensure that you have a copy of your code in case something goes wrong during the update process.

3. Update your code: Once you have checked the changelog and backed up your code, you can update your local copy of Black Mamba to the new release. This can be done by pulling the latest changes from the main branch or by downloading the new release from the Black Mamba GitHub repository.

4. Test your code: After updating to a new release, it's important to test your code to ensure that it still works as expected. This will help you catch any issues or conflicts that may have arisen during the update process.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your Black Mamba codebase is up-to-date and working smoothly with the latest improvements and features. Thank you for using Black Mamba!
